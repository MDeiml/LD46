Welcome to the cold and dark forests of the northern tundra! You just woke up and made a fire with your last match. Now your only chance to survive is to improve it until it is big enough to attract help.
Click somewhere to **walk** there and **pick things up** or **lay them down**.
Pick up wood and **throw it in your fire** by clicking on it, or else it will extinguish!
You can use your tools to chop wood or break stones.
